# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Of-Ipl-Dataset
📄 Description

This project focuses on analyzing ball-by-ball data from Indian Premier League (IPL) matches between the 2008 and 2016 seasons. The aim is to derive meaningful insights and perform predictive analysis, such as forecasting potential match outcomes based on historical data.

🏏 About the Game

Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of eleven players on a field, featuring a 22-yard pitch with wickets at each end. Each team alternates between batting and fielding, with the primary goal being to score more runs than the opponent. More details can be found on Wikipedia.
